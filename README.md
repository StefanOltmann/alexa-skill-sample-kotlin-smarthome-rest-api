# Alexa Skill Sample: Smarthome REST API (Kotlin)

This is a basic Alexa Smart Home skill sample that uses a REST API as backend. 

I made an Alexa skill as part of my Smart Home project and this is a simplified version of it.

It's fully functional for switches (on/off) and dimmers (percentage).

Please see source code comments and unit tests for a deeper understanding.

## Instructions

To use this sample, follow these [Instructions](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-java-smarthome-switch/blob/master/instructions/README.md).

I wrote this clean Kotlin version after reviewing the [official Alexa Smart Home Java sample](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-java-smarthome-switch).
